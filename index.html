        <div class="d-grid gap-1 col-10 mx-auto">
            <p>-They do not have Communication skills. The basic and very first thing at which any MNC will look are
                communication and interpersonal skills. The need of the hour is not (only) technical knowledge but,
                these skills too.

            </p>

            <h4>Technical Skills Required by MNCs ---></h4>

            <h5>1. Strong Programming Foundation :</h5>
            <p>To write a big code, you need to know the core fundamentals of programming. No matter which project you
                choose to work on in the future, if your fundamentals are strong, you will be able to work well.</p>

            <h5>2. Data Structures and Algorithms :</h5>
            <p>Many large companies look for people having in-depth knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms since it
                shows that they will be able to solve complex problems well. In today’s competitive world, knowing just
                the programming language syntax isn’t enough. You need to be equipped with skills that can be applied
                across technologies.</p>

            <h5>3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) :
            </h5>

            <p>AI is a field that aims at developing a system having human capabilities. AI, Machine Learning, NLP, etc.
                have a vast scope across areas and applications. Sectors like healthcare, tourism, etc. can benefit a
                lot from AI. Many tech giants, as well as startups, are trying to develop systems using AI and Machine
                Learning. There is a shortage of skilled people in these fields, so having skills in any of these
                lucrative fields has a lot of value.
            </p>


            <h5>4. Full Stack Development :</h5>

            <p>Since a Full Stack Developer works on multiple technologies and can handle the server-side as well as the
                client-side applications, they are in demand these days. Many technologies like React JS, Node JS are
                widely used by Full Stack Developers.
            </p>


            <h5>5. Mobile App Development :
            </h5>

            <p>Almost everyone these days used mobile phones. The usage of mobile apps has increased exponentially
                across countries. MNCs see a lot of scope in Mobile App Development, and people with knowledge of
                Android, iOS, etc. are in demand.
            </p>
